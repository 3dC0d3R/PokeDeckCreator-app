## Design
crud
<p align="center">This app allows the user to create a Pokemon Playing Cards Deck (PokeDeck) from the user Card Library. The PokeDeck is created by 1. Adding acquired Pokemon cards to the user Card Library and 2. Moving the Cards to the PokeDeck. The user can then edit the card, by updating stats, changing pokemon names, and deleting from either PokeDeck or the Card Library. </p>
